# Contribution guidelines

ContainerCollection is an open source library, we welcome contributors. 

Before you send a PR, however, please make sure your change complies with these quick guidelines:

- Always unit test your code, PR won't be approved without it.
- Document APIs, in a way that makes new users of those APIs understand how they work, and highlight things that are good to keep in mind when using them.
